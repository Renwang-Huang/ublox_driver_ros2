The *ublox_driver_ros2* provides essential functionalities for u-blox GNSS receivers. We greatly appreciate the contributions from https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/ublox_driver, which have enabled us to develop and support navigation research for various u-blox products in the ROS environment, including applications in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other robotic fields. However, with the advancement of technology, the original ROS driver package no longer provides support for the ROS 2 version. Building upon the foundation of Project A, we have further developed and optimized the u-blox driver to support ROS 2, enhancing and refining its related functionalities.

The following diagram shows all possible input and output options supported by *ublox_driver_ros2*.
